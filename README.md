I have done following enhacements which has improved the overall pinching experience.
 - Smoothen the pinching experience to reduce flickering as user pinches-in & out. 
 - Ensuring that the 3x3 grid is not deformed/disintegrated if pinching is done too much/too wide.

Attached videos demonstrates the improved user experience for pinching in/out. Two videos are attached - one from simulator and other from actual iPhone device.
